# Text Encoding Initiative Technical Contributor Repository

The [TEI](https://www.tei-c.org) is an international and interdisciplinary standard used by libraries, museums, publishers, and academics to represent all kinds of literary and linguistic texts, using an encoding scheme that is maximally expressive and minimally obsolescent.

This repository contains the resources for the TEI Technical Contributor Program. The Technical Contributor Program is an initiative by the TEI Technical Council to offer mentoring on editing, testing, and building the [TEI P5 Guidelines](https://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/index.html). Technical Contributors working on the Guidelines will primarily be using the [P5 directory](https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/tree/dev/P5).

Some notes on working with Git and on the TEI Guidelines GitHub repository may be found in the following document:
